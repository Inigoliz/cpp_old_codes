on windows:

- download and install "VMware Workstation Player" for windows

  . it can be found in:

  https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads

  . this software is free, so avoid the "Pro" version which is not
    free.

  . at installation level, it requires an e-mail address

- download an image of xubuntu (iso file):

  . the file xubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-i386.iso can be found here:

    ftp://ftp.free.fr/mirrors/ftp.xubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/xubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-i386.iso

- execute VMWare player:

    . the installation of the xubuntu virtual machine will require at least 20GB of free disk space

      if this is not available, an external hard drive can be used but it might significantly slow down the processes

    . select "Create a new virtual machine"

    . "Installer disc image file (iso):" browse and select the iso file of xubuntu  

    . follow the steps. During installation, it asks to introduce a full name, a username and a password to be used in xubuntu

    . note: the process might fail with an error like this:

      "This host supports Intel vt-x, but Intel VT-x is disabled"

      in this case, you will need to reboot into the BIOS and enable VT (virtualization options)

- xubuntu:

   . after the installation process, xubuntu will boot. In the VMplayer window, you will be asked to introduce the password of your account [the one chosen in a previous step] to log into xubuntu

   . for a first use of xubuntu, a software update window might pop-up: proceed with this update. After that, you will be asked to reboot the system

   . log in again with your password. Use Ctrl-Alt-T to open a terminal window
   
   . check whether g++, emacs, gnuplot, xpdf, ... are installed. If not, install them by typing:

       sudo apt-get install g++
       sudo apt-get install emacs
       sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11
       ...
